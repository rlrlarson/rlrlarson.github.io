	<h2>About Me</h2>
	<p>I am a Computer Science major in the School of Engineering at Tufts University in Medford,
		MA, with an expected graduation date of May 2017. I am also pursuing a minor in Human 
		Factors, as I am very interested in how we can design interfaces and technology to best
		interact with humans. I also enjoy reading, hiking, and kayaking. I am originally from San Mateo, CA.
