          Hi! I’m Rebecca, a UX designer with a technical background and a passion for
          creating great products that make people’s lives easier. As a computer science
          engineer, I understand the complexity of a problem and how to break it down
          into solvable pieces. As a designer, I transform those complex problems into
          simplistic, fluid experiences for the user. I thrive in collaborative, interdisciplinary
          environments, and am skilled in cross-functional leadership, communication, and presentation.

                      <p>I worked on a project to expand the data visualization and story sharing capabilities for Resilia's platform for nonprofit users.</p> 
                      <p>Storytelling is an essential part of funding and community support for nonprofits, specifically the ability to weave numbers and narrative to tell a comprehensive, compelling story. Resilia’s product was able to share narrative stories - qualitative data - publicly to social media channels. The product can also store quantitative data in the form of charts. However, there was no way for users share that data. This project developed a solution to address that gap, and provide a way for users to share that quantitative data to their donors.</p>
                      <p>I was the lead designer for this project, executing the user research, ideation, wireframing, usability testing, and hi fidelity designs. I partnered with a Product Manager and and Engineering Lead to make strategic decisions throughout this process.</p>

                      <h4>User Problem</h4>
                      <p>Nonprofits are expected by funders and individual donors to prove impact quantitatively, so it’s essential that nonprofits have the ability to share their recorded data to these audiences. However, quantitative data is often stored in Excel spreadsheets, making it hard to find, understand, and summarize for the public. Additionally, nonprofits rarely have designers or marketing teams who can share the data in digestible formats. 

                      Nonprofit founders are looking for ways to store, organize, and share their quantitative data without needing to hire data scientists or graphic designers.</p>

                      <h4>Business Value</h4>
                      <p>Our customers were frequently asking for the ability to share their quantitative data stored in Resilia’s product. We saw that they were taking screenshots of the charts to include in presentations, or asking for a “Download Chart” feature to grab the data for their use.
                        We knew as a company that becoming the primary storage location of a nonprofit’s data would make them more invested in our tool and more likely to be a retained customer. If we provided an easy way to store and share their data, their two primary data needs, customers would be more likely to invest in Resilia long term. 
                        Additionally, if they used Resilia to share data publicly, we could have our logo and link on each shared item as an advertising opportunity.</p>

                      <h4>User Research</h4>
                      <p>Since this problem area emerged from past research done on our impact tracking tools, I was able to take advantage of previous findings to better narrow in on the problem area around sharing quantitative data. The most relevant findings were:
                        <ol type="1">
                          <li>Users need to share digestible data without designers.</li> 
                          <li>Users find it hard to make sense of the raw data and don’t understand what from it is important to share.</li>
                          <li>Users need to pair quantitative data with qualitative data to build a full story for their audiences.</li>
                        </ol>
                        I also conducted competitive analysis on tools nonprofit employees currently use to share quantitative data, such as Excel and Canva. </p>

                    <div class="col-12 col-md-6">
                      <h4>Ideating Solutions</h4>
                      <p>The Product Manager and I brainstormed decided to address these primary problem areas by providing a snapshot of the chart that we called a “Progress Report.” This progress report would be: 
                      <ol type="1">
                        <li>Pre-designed and ready to share</li>
                        <li>Be automatically generated and prompted at certain progress points after users update the raw quantitative data</li>
                        <li>Have the ability to be shared in the context of a qualitative narrative</li></p>
                      </ol>
                    </div>
                  </div>

                    <h4>Concept Testing</h4>
                    <p>I worked on design ideas that would prompt the user with this progress report asset with an opportunity to share it and narrowed the design solutions down into two concepts.</p>
                    <p>Concept A: A progress report opens in a side panel.</p>
                  </div>

                  <div class="row">

                    <div class="col-12 col-md-6">
                      <p>Pros</p>
                      <ol type="1">
                        <li>Re-uses a design pattern established in the product as a place to show detail and take action.</li>
                        <li>Provides more real estate for users to build a qualitative story, integrating an existing Storybuilder feature into this data tracking part of the product, around their asset if desired.</li>
                        <li>Seeing the chart and the progress report side by side might help a user better understand how the data is being summarized (to be tested).</li>
                      </ol>
                      <p>Cons</p>
                      <ol type="1">
                        <li>Having a prompt appear in a side panel is not a common prompt pattern.</li>
                        <li>Introducing Storybuilder into a side panel expands our scope.</li>

                      <ol type="1">
                        <li>This is a typical prompt pattern that users will likely recognize.</li>
                        <li>It is less intrusive on the screen, so as to let users easily dismiss the prompt and continue with their workflow.</li>
                      </ol>
                      <p>Cons</p>
                      <ol type="1">
                        <li>The user might miss the importance of this prompt.</li>
                        <li>The real estate is small, so would need to open a new page if any action on the progress report was taken, adding a step.</li>
                        <li>It is not an existing design pattern.</li>
                      </ol>

                  </div>

                  <p>I set up an unmoderated A/B test with User Testing to assess these two concepts.</p>

                      <ul>
                        <li>6 out of 9 users preferred the side panel prompt to the overlay.</li>
                        <li>All users found the process of sharing an asset usable and straightforward.</li>
                        <li>A couple users highlighted that they liked the “Download” action on the asset so they could have more control over how and where they shared it.</li>
                        <li>A couple areas of opportunity surfaced in testing.</li>
                        <ul>
                          <li>The “Share” buttons on the side panel could be more prominent.</li>
                          <li>Several users wanted to edit the infographic, showing interest in updating the color to match their branding, using an absolute value instead of percent, and having a variety of graphics or layouts to choose from for each infographic.</li>
                        </ul>

                  <h4>Design</h4>
                  <p>With the outcomes of the concept test and areas of opportunity surfaced, I iterated on the design of the side panel concept from lo to hi fidelity.</p>

                  <h4>Launch</h4>
                  <p>The development of this project was very difficult, as we were using new technologies to generate the infographic and it was the first time in our product history that two different sections were being integrated. This required increased collaboration across teams and re-usability within the codebase. I worked closely with the engineering lead to ensure the developed solution met the designed one, and strategically adjusted when technical constraints arose. </p>
                  <p>With the dedication of the product manager and engineering team, we successfully launched the project and I organized a demo to present the new features to customers as part of our go to market strategy.</p>

                      <p>I led the cross-functional initiative to establish actionable personas for Resilia. The objective of this project was to define user personas from cross-functional insights and research that could be used across the organization to better understand users and make more informed product decisions.</p>

                      <h4>Business Value</h4>
                      <p>User personas explain who Resilia is serving with their platform and services. They create organization alignment and unified understanding of users, using a common language. Personas allow organizations to make faster strategic decisions, better prioritize features and initiatives, and build empathy to center the user in decision making.</p>
                      <p>It was essential to have cross-functional input on this initiative so it remained relevant and valuable across the organization to ensure adoption by all teams.</p>

                      <p>I partnered with another designer to conduct a workshop of cross-functional Subject Matter Experts to ideate initial definitions for our personas.</p>
                      <h7>REFINEMENT</h7>
                      <p>I used stakeholder surveys and data to narrow areas of ambiguity ad better include nuance in the defined personas.</p>

                  <h4>Next Steps: Personas in Action</h4>
                  <p>After presenting these personas to the organization, I led a monthly meeting of cross-functional stakeholders to ensure that personas were actionable and embedded into decision making processes across the organization. This initiative had quarterly objectives and defined steps to reach those objectives.</p>
                  <p>Our goal was to be able to assess each of Resilia’s users’ persona in order to provide a more personalized, relevant product experience. This would give users more value and thus increase the likelihood of their retention.</p>
                  <p>This was a huge cross functional effort. To achieve this assessment of persona, the Personas Team defined the set of data that could indicate a user’s persona. A pod focused on user activation worked to collect zero-party data to learn more about our nonprofit users early in their Resilia experience. The data analytics team built out a predictive model that could take key data points to predict a user’s persona. The customer solutions team integrated a method for Resilia’s in house experts to additionally assess nonprofits’ personas to provide base data for the predictive model. And lastly, the in house experts, Resilia’s nonprofit coaches, provided persona assessments for existing users with data to inform the data model.</p>
                  <p>This initiative not only defined Resilia’s key user personas, but worked to make them easily actionable in team decisions and personalize the users’ experience.</p>

                      <h4>Summary</h4>
                      <p>This project addressed a top need of nonprofits -- the ability to share stories that engage certain audiences to build community support, spread awareness, or receive funding. Resilia’s platform had the ability to publish a public link to a story with text and images, but we found that this feature did not sufficiently meet the nonprofit users’ needs. We spent this project re-doing our story sharing features in an effort we called Storybuilder.</p>
                      <p>I was the lead designer on this project and worked with a product manager, engineering lead, and received feedback from the design team.</p>

                      <h4>User Problem</h4>
                      <p>While storytelling is necessary to be a high performing nonprofit, many nonprofits struggle with this time consuming task and don’t have marketing resources who can dedicate their time to publishing stories. Writing and publishing stories about the nonprofit’s work ends up being extra responsibilities on employees and is difficult to balance with their primary roles.</p>
                      <p>Through user research, we found that one of the biggest challenges in publishing stories was the overhead. Users felt overwhelmed when starting a blog post or story from scratch and didn’t want to spend extra time formatting and designing the post.</p>
                      <p>Resilia’s solution needed to reduce the amount of time it took to put together, format, and share a story.</p>

                      <p>This feature was important to Resilia’s platform as the need was consistently a primary problem area in our research. Since storytelling was a must have at every nonprofit, if Resilia’s nonprofit customers used the platform for their storytelling, the platform would be much more valuable to the users, increasing retention. This provided an opportunity for Resilia’s platform to store nonprofit data and thus become more “sticky.” Additionally, Resilia’s brand awareness would increase with each story shared.</p>

                  <h4>Hi Fi Designs</h4>
                  <p>After demos to senior leadership, concept testing, and usability testing, we landed on final designs for this Storybuilder project.</p>
                  <p>The final concept was a WYSIWYG drag and drop builder, with each story element having a corresponding library that users can select from. The clarity and delight of the drag and drop tested well with users. We removed the multi-step process as it created perceived extra overhead and didn’t let users determine their priorities in creating, categorizing, and sharing stories.</p>

                  <h4>Next Steps</h4>
                  <p>After launching this feature through product newsletters and demos, we monitored the usage data to analyze it’s success and opportunities for improvement. From this, we continued to iterate on the Storybuilder feature by integrating a share to social media method and including view and click data for users on each story.</p>

                        <h4>Summary</h4> 
                        <p>
                          This project involved a complete redesign of Pega’s internal sales mobile application. The sales app is used by the entire sales organization, from sales reps to the CEO. The redesign began with both an exploration of current consumer grade mobile app design and an analysis of user feedback collected on the existing sales app. We used these insights to modernize the look and feel of the app, restructure the information architecture, and add key functionality.

                          I have managed this project through the end-to-end product development, from research to design to usability testing, and I currently lead the pilot of this app as we test it in the field. I continuously work with the product and engineering teams to advocate for the user and ensure the final product matches the design.
                        </p>

                        <h4>Context</h4>
                        <p>
                          Sales reps are constantly traveling to meet prospects and customers, and therefore need a way to do work while in transit, but we found they weren’t using the existing sales mobile app.

                          Our task was to investigate why sales reps weren’t using the current mobile app and redesign the app to improve the experience.
                        </p>   

                        <h4>Business Value</h4>
                        <p>
                          This mobile app would help hundreds of Pega sales reps, managers, and leaders across the world and allow them to access information and complete work on the go. By reducing the tedious, manual tasks of their day to day, sales reps can focus on the higher value aspect of their work -- building and maintaining relationships.

                          The app redesign would also drive the next generation of mobile UI and interactions across all of Pega’s mobile offerings.

                      <h4>User Research</h4>
                      <p>
                        We began this process by conducting user research. We sent out surveys and had one on one interviews to learn user needs and pain points with their existing sales process to identify opportunities a mobile app could help. This research also addressed where the existing app fell short.

                        After synthesizing the feedback, we identified patterns to set priorities for the redesign.

                        <h4>Key Takeaways</h4>
                        <ul>
                          <li>Users didn’t think it felt like a native app</li>
                          <li>Users found the performance to be too slow</li>
                          <li>Users felt like they couldn’t do much of their work using the app</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4>Project Goals</h4>                      
                        <ul>
                          <li>Revamp the look and feel to make the app appear more native and usable</li>

                  <h4>Design</h4>
                  <p>
                    To update the look and feel of the app, we analyzed current leading mobile apps for patterns and interactions. After iterating through several UI theme ideas, we landed on a clean, light look to move away from the heavy, clunky feel of the previous sales app.

                        The push to improve performance was largely a technical effort, but to complement that goal from the design side, we redid the information architecture of the app to mirror the user’s workflow and priorities identified in our research. This updated IA would help provide quick access to the user’s most common tasks.

                        <br>
                        In deciding what functionality to add to the app, we assessed sales reps’ most common and important tasks that would be valuable to have on mobile. We designed each new feature in our new UI, defining new patterns where necessary to inform our mobile design system.

                      Throughout the development of the mobile app, I worked closely with the engineers to ensure the design was implemented and make any modifications according to technical limitations.

                      After the app was built, I ran a pilot to evaluate its real-world use. We involved 50 users from across the sales organization to gather feedback through in-app community boards, surveys, and user interviews. Assessing the app through real users and use cases gave invaluable insight into where the app succeeded, where modifications needed to be made, and what we should prioritize for the next release.

                    I am now also collaborating with our design system team to standardize the patterns introduced in the sales app as they become an established part of Pega’s design system.

                        This project aids sales reps in scheduling client agendas for Pega’s annual conference, PegaWorld. The impetus for this agenda app came from research that was originally intended to expand functionality Pega's internal sales mobile app. However, because we used open-ended research methods, we identified the previously unknown user need to automate this time-consuming and tedious part of a sales reps PegaWorld preparation. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        We designed, tested, and prototyped a scheduling web application. I developed the prototype using Flask to connect a Postgres database of the conference sessions to the front end built in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Using this live prototype, the user can easily create a customized agenda for each client and automatically save it as calendar events.

                      <p>
                        Sales Automation was the first end-user application at Pegasystems to adopt our new design system, Cosmos. As lead designer, I redesigned the application with the new components and patterns. Since my product area was the first adopter, we focused on unifying existing patterns and identifying opportunities for new patterns. I worked actively with end user apps to gather use cases and prioritize our design system roadmap. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        One of the huge UX advantages in the new Cosmos design system is the information architecture of a case page, as it is now organized modularly. One example of a universal pattern I helped define was how to decide what types of data lives where. We decided the essential static object data would live on the left side summary panel. The activity feed is prioritized and surfaced in the middle of the organization page. On the right panel, we use utilities to show dynamic information about the organization, such as the LinkedIn widget, organization news, sales team, and attachments.

                    <p>
                      This project was done with a team as part of a final project for a Harvard Extension School course. It aims to derive insights about food access and attributes across the US by evaluating how these factors affect the health of a community. We worked to solve the question, ‘How can policy makers introduce policies that are the most effective at bettering the health of a county?’ This interactive visualization is designed for policy makers to better understand what changes could improve the health of their county.

                    <h4>Background</h4> 
                    <p>
                      There are many factors that influence the health of a community -- ranging from culture, income, food access, healthy food options, welfare programs, etc. Each county differs across these variables and therefore changing certain variables (for example, adding more grocery stores or reducing the number of fast food restaurants) affect the health of the county uniquely from others.

                <h4>Process</h4>
                <p>
                  To accomplish our goal, we used data from the USDA Food Environment Atlas. This dataset contains data at the county level and has many features, including access to restaurants, grocery stores, farmers markets and welfare programs, as well as demographic and health data. We first focused on the back-end data to refine our project goal. We conducted exploratory data analysis, applied feature engineering, and created our data model to establish how a user could best digest the data and how we could best predict the health of a county. Then, we designed and built our front-end web application to navigate the data and created a prediction calculator where a user could interact with our data model.
                </p>

                <h4>Web Application Overview</h4>
                <p>
                  Policy makers can see a visual summary of the US according to variables that influence the health of each community uniquely — such as income, food access, and healthy food options — both though a full map of all counties and three more linked visualizations that show deeper details on specific variables. The user can make further discoveries on a narrowed county level with linked visualizations that can drill down into each county and the Obesity Prediction Calculator, that tests how changing certain variables can influence the health of that county. This application gives policy makers comprehensive insight into the trends and specifics of the country and each county, and provides guidance in policies they should target to best help a specific county.
                </p>

                <h4>Challenges</h4>
                <p>
                  One of the most immediate challenges in this project was our dataset. After selecting features, we found that about half of our data had at least one null value in each county, so the entire county had to be dropped from the prediction model. Having all of the county data would have made our model more accurate and could show the user more accurate trends. Another challenge was figuring out at what level our model should predict. We originally wanted to have separate models for each state with the understanding that there were many cultural factors not captured in the data, and were hoping to account for this by narrowing our focus to a state level. However, we only had county level data and most states have too few counties to build an accurate model around.
                </p>

                <h4>Conclusion</h4>
                <p>
                  This web application provides a solid jumping off point to further investigate this idea of county-specific food policy. To have better accuracy, one would need more recent data with more relevant variables. The inaccuracy in the obesity prediction calculator indicates that there are likely many factors that influence community health that cannot be perfectly capture by a number, reinforcing that policy makers should not rely solely on data to introduce policy into a community. They should incorporate the voice of the community to have a fuller understanding and work with the community to find effective solutions.

                      This project explores alcohol consumption around the world. There exist certain stereotypes about which countries drink which types of alcohol and we wanted to build a platform to either confirm or debunk these stereotypes with this visualization. While we had fun exploring alcohol stereotypes, this interactive visualization reveals how alcohol consumption reflects the world’s history and culture through a unique perspective. We used data from the World Health Organization, which collected the average consumption of wine, beer, and spirits in liters per capita per year for every country, spanning from 1960 to 2010.
